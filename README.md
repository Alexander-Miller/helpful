A better Help buffer.

SCREENSHOT

Helpful will:

Always **show the source code** of functions. It shows the
source code for interactively defined functions (unlike the built-in
Help) and falls back to the raw sexp if no source is available.

Display **symbol properties**. This provides visibility of features
like edebug or byte-code optimisation.

Show **references**. You can see where a function is being called!
